            The design process timeline depends on the size and complexity of
            your project. For smaller spaces, like a bathroom vanity, we can
            provide an initial design concept within a week. For larger
            projects, involving multiple rooms or custom furniture pieces, the
            timeline may extend to several weeks. We'll work closely with you
            throughout the process to ensure your dream becomes a reality.
            <br /><br>
            Yes, we absolutely offer customization options! We understand that
            your furniture should reflect your unique style and needs. Feel
            free to inquire about customizing existing designs or creating
            something entirely new.

            Yes, we can! We understand that budgets are important, and we're
            happy to work with you to create a furniture plan that fits your
            needs. During the design consultation, we can discuss your budget
            and explore various options to achieve your dream design. This
            might involve suggesting alternative materials, adjusting the
            scope of the project, or offering financing options

            This might be due to a temporary bank server issue. We recommend
            waiting a few hours for the transaction to complete and for your
            order confirmation to arrive. In the unlikely event that the order
            doesn't get placed due to the bank issue, the debited amount will
            be automatically refunded to your account by your bank within a
            specific timeframe (details may vary depending on your bank's
            policies)

            issues arising from improper assembly or care. For detailed information on what's covered and
            excluded, please refer to the warranty card included with your furniture purchase. If you
            experience an issue with your furniture that you believe falls under the warranty, please contact
